**AutoAI ‚Äì IBM Project**

This project demonstrates the power of **IBM AutoAI**, an automated machine learning solution that simplifies the process of **building, training, and deploying AI models**. Instead of manually handling tasks like **data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning**, AutoAI automatically analyzes your dataset, identifies the best-performing models, and optimizes them for production use. It was made on **IBM Cloud** for easy access and bettre development as a fresher to this project. 

The goal of this project is to **accelerate the AI development lifecycle**, making it easier for developers, students, and data scientists to focus on **insights and decision-making** rather than repetitive coding tasks.

With this project, you will learn how **IBM AutoAI** can:

* Automatically preprocess and clean raw data
* Select the most suitable machine learning algorithms
* Optimize models with minimal human intervention
* Provide deployable, ready-to-use AI solutions

## üîπ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AutoAI.git
cd AutoAI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üîπ Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using Python API

```python
from autoai import AutoAI

# Initialize AutoAI
model = AutoAI()

# Train model on your dataset
model.fit("data.csv", target_column="target")

# Predict on new data
predictions = model.predict("new_data.csv")

# Evaluate performance
model.evaluate()
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Using Command Line

```bash
python autoai.py --train data.csv --target target
```
